## Database Schema (Planned)
```sql
-- Core Tables
CREATE TABLE tickets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    subject VARCHAR(500),
    content TEXT,
    category_id INT,
    priority_level INT,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE categories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT
);
```

## API Endpoints (In Development)
```
POST /api/tickets/create      # Create new ticket
GET  /api/tickets/{id}       # Get ticket details
POST /api/ai/classify       # AI classification
GET  /api/tickets/search    # Semantic search
```
